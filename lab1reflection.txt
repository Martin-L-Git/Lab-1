1. Explain how you chose the inheritance hierarchy in Task 1, making reference to the Open-Closed Principle.

We started of with creating a superclass called "Car" that was inherited by both the Saab and the Volvo classes. Then we put all of the common
functionality, attributes and methods into car. The ones that were exactly the same betweern both the Saab and the Volvo were deleted from the
subclasses and put in "Car", whereas the ones that were similar but with some differences were added as abstract classes in Car and overrridden in the subclasses. 
Thanks to this we don't have to reuse code. It also makes the code modular




2. Explain how you implemented each of the sanity checks in Task 4.
ARe you insane!!!
